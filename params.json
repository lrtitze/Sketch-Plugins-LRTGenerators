{"name":"Sketch-plugins-LRTGenerators","tagline":"Sketch 3 plugin scripts for generating object collections","body":"### Welcome to the Generator Plugins\r\n\r\nFor various projects there was a need to create Sketch 3 plugin scripts which could generate object collections. I'll share them with you here since they could be useful or serve as examples for solving your own problems.\r\n\r\n**WARNING:** I'm trying to track down a bug that causes Sketch to crash after the second or third time these scripts are run with block counts higher than 63. Be very careful and make sure that you save all of your work before trying to use these with high block counts.\r\n\r\n## Script #1 - Random Colored Box Grid\r\n\r\nThis command creates a square group of boxes whose colors are randomly selected from three preset colors. The colors, number of squares per side and the size of the squares can be set by modifying the script.\r\n\r\n```\r\n// Set the number of blocks on a side and their size.\r\nvar blockCount = 30;\r\nvar blockSize = 10;\r\n\r\n// Default colors\r\nvar darkColor  = [MSColor colorWithRed:0.2 green:0.0 blue:0.0 alpha:1.0];\r\nvar midColor   = [MSColor colorWithRed:0.5 green:0.1 blue:0.1 alpha:1.0];\r\nvar lightColor = [MSColor colorWithRed:1.0 green:0.0 blue:0.0 alpha:1.0];\r\n```\r\n\r\nAs provided, the script generates this group of objects:\r\n\r\n![](http://lrtitze.github.io/Sketch-Plugins-LRTGenerators/images/RandomNoiseBox.png)\r\n![](images/RandomNoiseBox.png)\r\n\r\n## Script #2 - Random Colored Bitmap Grid\r\n\r\nThis command creates the same pattern as #1 but inserts a single image bitmap to Sketch instead of a group of shape objects.\r\n\r\nThis could be a starting point for anyone who wants to draw into an NSImage and place the result into the Sketch document. The idea for this drawing method came from looking at the *NSImage Draw Buttons* example in the [CocoaScript GitHub repository](https://github.com/ccgus/CocoaScript).\r\n\r\n```\r\n// Set the number of blocks on a side and their size.\r\nvar blockCount = 30;\r\nvar blockSize = 10;\r\n\r\n// Default colors\r\nvar darkColor  = [NSColor colorWithRed:0.0 green:1.0 blue:0.0 alpha:1.0];\r\nvar midColor   = [NSColor colorWithRed:0.1 green:0.5 blue:0.1 alpha:1.0];\r\nvar lightColor = [NSColor colorWithRed:0.0 green:0.2 blue:0.0 alpha:1.0];\r\n```\r\n\r\nAs provided, the script generates this bitmap:\r\n\r\n![](http://lrtitze.github.io/Sketch-Plugins-LRTGenerators/images/RandomNoiseBitmap.png)\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### More to come\r\n\r\nI have a few more of these that will be added soon.\r\n\r\n### Contact\r\nOn App.net or Twitter I can be found at: lrtitze\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
