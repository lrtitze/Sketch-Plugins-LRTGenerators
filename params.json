{"name":"Sketch-plugins-LRTGenerators","tagline":"Sketch 3 plugin scripts for generating object collections","body":"### Welcome to the Generator Plugins\r\n\r\nFor various projects there was a need to create Sketch 3 plugin scripts which could generate object collections. I'll share them with you here since they could be useful or serve as examples for solving your own problems.\r\n\r\n### Random Colored Box Grid\r\n\r\n![](images/RandomNoiseBox.png)\r\n\r\nThis command creates a square group of boxes whose colors are randomly selected from three preset colors. The colors, number of squares per side and the size of the squares can be set by modifying the script.\r\n\r\n```\r\n// Set the number of blocks on a side and their size.\r\nvar blockCount = 30;\r\nvar blockSize = 10;\r\n\r\n// Default colors\r\nvar darkColor  = [MSColor colorWithRed:0.2 green:0.0 blue:0.0 alpha:1.0];\r\nvar midColor   = [MSColor colorWithRed:0.5 green:0.1 blue:0.1 alpha:1.0];\r\nvar lightColor = [MSColor colorWithRed:1.0 green:0.0 blue:0.0 alpha:1.0];\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### More still to come\r\n\r\nI have a few more of these that will be added soon.\r\n\r\n### Contact\r\nOn App.net or Twitter I can be found at: lrtitze\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
